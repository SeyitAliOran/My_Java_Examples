      (Science: calculating energy)
      Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an
      initial temperature to a final temperature;
      Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms
      and the initial and final temperatures of the water.

      The formula to compute the energy is
           Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
      where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius,
      and energy Q is measured in joules.
